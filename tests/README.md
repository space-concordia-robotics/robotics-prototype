# Tests
This is where we keep our tests and group them according to type.
So far we have some sample unit tests, and an empty folder for feature tests.

## Unit tests
Testing an individual unit, such as a method (function) in a class, with all dependencies mocked up.

## Functional tests
AKA Integration Test, testing a slice of functionality in a system. This will test many methods and may interact with dependencies like Databases or Web Services.

## Benchmark tests
Tests in order to assess the relative performance of an object, normally by running a number of standard tests and trials against it.
These tests are usually associated with assessing performance characteristics of computer hardware.

# Prototype tests
Tests developed during prototyping.
