# Installation Guide
This document describes how to build and install the *JetsonGPIO* from the source code.

### 0. Prerequisites
To build *JetsonGPIO* from the source code, the following prerequisites are needed:

- `git` (for cloning the source code from GitHub)
- `CMake` (3.2 or higher)
- A C++ compiler that supports C++11 (ex> `g++`, `clang`, etc)
- Build automation tools (ex> `GNU Make`, `Ninja`, etc)

### 1. Clone the repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/pjueon/JetsonGPIO
```

### 2. Make build directory and change directory to it. 

```
cd JetsonGPIO
mkdir build && cd build
```

### 3. Configure the cmake
```
cmake .. [OPTIONS]
```

|Option|Default value|Description|
|------|-------------|-----------|
|`-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`|`/usr/local`|Installation path|
|`-DBUILD_EXAMPLES=`|ON|Build example codes in `samples`|
|`-DJETSON_GPIO_POST_INSTALL=`|ON|Run the post-install script after installation to set user permissions. If you set this `OFF`, you must run your application as root to use *JetsonGPIO*.|

### 4. Build and Install the library
```
sudo cmake --build . --target install
```

## Compiling the Samples
You can add cmake option `-DBUILD_EXAMPLES=ON` to build example codes in `samples`.
Assuming you are in `build` directory:
```
cmake .. -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=ON
cmake --build . --target examples 
```
You can find the compiled results in `build/samples`.
