# Package Components
*JetsonGPIO* library package contains the following:
1. The `src` and `include` subdirectories contain the C++ codes that implement all library functionality. The `JetsonGPIO.h` file in the `include` subdirectory is the only header file that should be included into an application and provides the needed APIs. 
2. The `samples` subdirectory contains sample applications to help in getting familiar with the library API and getting started on an application. 
3. The `tests` subdirectory contains test codes to test the library APIs and private utilities that are used to implement the library. Some test codes require specific setups. Check the required setups from the codes before you run them. 
4. The `docs` subdirectory contains documentation about *JetsonGPIO*.
