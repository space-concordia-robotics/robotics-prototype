/*
EXAMPLE SETUP
Connect a button to pin 18 and GND, a pull-up resistor connecting the button
to 3V3 and an LED connected to pin 12. The application performs the same
function as the button_led.py but performs a blocking wait for the button
press event instead of continuously checking the value of the pin in order to
reduce CPU usage.
