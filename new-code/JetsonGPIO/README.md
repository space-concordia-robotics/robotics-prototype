# JetsonGPIO (C++)
*JetsonGPIO* is an unofficial C++ adaptation of NVIDIA's Python library, [*Jetson.GPIO*](https://github.com/NVIDIA/jetson-gpio).

NVIDIA Jetson series development boards contain a 40 pin GPIO header, similar to the 40 pin header in the Raspberry Pi. These GPIOs can be controlled for digital input and output using this library. *JetsonGPIO* provides C++ APIs that are almost same as those of [*Jetson.GPIO*](https://github.com/NVIDIA/jetson-gpio).
